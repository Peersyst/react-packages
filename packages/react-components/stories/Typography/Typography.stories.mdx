# Typography

Typography is used to maintain a set of text variants in a centralized way. With this approach, readability is improved and the code is closer to the designs.

Also, it is really easy to customize existing variants, remove them or add new ones, as we'll se later on.

<Canvas>
    <Col gap={10}>
        <Typography variant="h1">Heading 1</Typography>
        <Typography variant="h2">Heading 2</Typography>
        <Typography variant="h3">Heading 3</Typography>
        <Typography variant="h4">Heading 4</Typography>
        <Typography variant="h5">Heading 5</Typography>
        <Typography variant="h6">Heading 6</Typography>
        <Typography variant="subtitle1">Subtitle 1</Typography>
        <Typography variant="subtitle2">Subtitle 2</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">Body 1</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2">Body 2</Typography>
        <Typography variant="button">Button text</Typography>
        <Typography variant="caption">Caption</Typography>
    </Col>
</Canvas>

## Usage

Just provide the variant you want and some style props you might want.

````jsx
<Col gap={10}>
    <Typography variant="subtitle1" textTransform="uppercase">Typography component is cool</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" light>Typography component is cool</Typography>
</Col>
````

<Canvas>
    <Col gap={10}>
        <Typography variant="subtitle1" textTransform="uppercase">Typography component is cool</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" light>Typography component is cool</Typography>
    </Col>
</Canvas>

## Theming

Typography can be customized with your custom theme:

````typescript
const myCustomTheme = createTheme({
    typography: {
        // Modify existing variant
        h1: {
            textDecoration: "underline",
        },
        // Remove existing variant
        subtitle2: undefined,
        // Add new variant
        title: {
            fontSize: "1.75rem",
        }
    }
})
````
````typescript
import "peersyst-react-components"

declare module "peersyst-react-components" {
    // Add title in theme type
    export interface ThemeTypography {
        title: TypographyVariant;
    }
    // Add title in create the type
    export interface CreateThemeTypography {
        title: TypographyVariant;
    }
    // Modify typography variants type
    export interface TypographyVariantsOverrides {
        subtitle2: false;
        title: true;
    }
}
````
