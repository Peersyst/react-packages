# TextArea

TextArea retrieves multiple lines of user input. This component is equivalent to TextField but changing its `<input />` inner tag for a `<textarea />` tag.

Also, a few props change. The main difference is that a textarea has cols and rows.

## Usage

The usage is the same as TextField. It can be controlled or uncontrolled as well.

```jsx
<TextArea placeholder="Write something long..." />
```

<Canvas>
    <TextArea placeholder="Write something long..." />
</Canvas>
