# useScrollTrigger

Hook from MUI that lets your components react to scroll.

## Usage

It returns a boolean whenever the scroll has passed the threshold provided.

This hook accepts the following options:

-   trigger: Custom trigger
-   threshold: Scroll threshold. Defaults to 100.
-   disableHysteresis: Trigger is only fired when scrolling from top to bottom. Defaults to false, so trigger is fired when scrolling from top to bottom and viceversa.
-   target: Scrollable element. Defaults to window.

```typescript
const trigger = useScrollTrigger({
    threshold: 0,
    disableHysteresis: true,
});
```
